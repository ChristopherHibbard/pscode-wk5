// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

let n = any number
conditional statement:
if n/2 = whole number then print even
if n/2 = decimal then print odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

begin
a)
ask rng 1 number, number = a
ask rng 1 number, number = b
ask rng 1 number, number = c
ask rng 1 number, number = d
ask rng 1 number, number = e

b)
(a+b+c+d+e)/5 = x

c)
sort decending a,b,c,d,e 
let last digit = y
sort ascending a,b,c,d,e
let last digit = z

d)
print x; average
print y; minimum
print z; maximum
